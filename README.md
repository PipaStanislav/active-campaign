# Active campaign
* * *

This package I hope will help to work with `Active Campaign` API.

## Note
* * *

I created this package for my own use. \
In my project, I used not all functionality which proposes `Active Campaign`. \
So I do not know which result you can get. I tested all based on `Active Campaign` documentation \
If you find some bugs, or you want to improve something to be free to create issues or merge requests. \
I will try to be communicable.
